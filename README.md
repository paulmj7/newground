# Newground

REUPLOADED for security purposes

Newground is a startup consulting firm that specializes in locating and harvesting banking data of over 
76,000 Capital One banking clients throughout all 50 U.S. states.


Our target clientele are businesses looking to expand to new locations and would like access to
data about the citizens of different potential areas. With our technology, our partners are able to 
screen the 76,000 banking clients in our database based on factors such as disposable income and
zip code.


In the era of ecommerce and online shopping, businesses that aim to expand to new physical locations
must rely on intensive research and analysis before breaking new ground. Navigating a new location can
be difficult, don't do it alone. Reach new spaces. Reach new goals. Reach new ground.


## Development Tools

Front-end development was carried out with Jinja, Python, and CSS. Back-end development was supported
with Python and Flask.


## Team Members

* Paul Jones, Head of Software Development and Project Management

* Brian Restrepo, Front-end Developer
* Mason Snavely, Backend Developer


## Installation

You'll want to edit the source code to include to include your GitHub api key, although I'm unsure of the current status of the Nessie API provided by Capital One (Written post-competition)

First install requirement packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application
```
FLASK_APP=server.py flask run
